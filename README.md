# serialkiller-project
Introduction:
I started this project because I am fascinated with true crime and I wanted to learn more about serial killers. For a while now, criminologist have studied the mind of a serial killer to further understand their motives and drives. For this project, I am not interested in what motivates a serial killer. I am more interested in who the serial killer is able to kill. If we concentrate our attention on the groups that serial killers constantly target, we would do a lot more to reduce the incidence of serial murder in our culture.

For the data analysis, I loaded the dataset into Excel. I analyzed and created visualization charts in Excel. I created a slide deck using Powerpoint to communicate my findings.

You can check out my analysis by clicking on the Excel file or Powerpoint file.

Data Source:
The data source for this analysis can be found in Kaggle. The data was compiled and made available by the Murder Accountability Project, founded by Thomas Hargrove.
